Java Coding Interview Preparation Sheet (For 2-Year Experience)
SECTION 1 – Core Java & OOP (Foundation)

Build your base and demonstrate real Java understanding.

Q1. Explain and implement a Singleton class (thread-safe).
Q2. Create an Immutable class (similar to String).
Q3. Demonst
rate method overloading vs overriding.
Q4. Write a class to show deep copy vs shallow copy.Q5. Implement Factory Design Pattern.
Q6. Create a Builder Pattern for an object like User.
Q7. Write a program to override equals() and hashCode() properly.
Q8. Implement Enum-based Singleton (advanced).

SECTION 2 – String Programs

Most common in interviews for logic & algorithmic thinking.

Q1. Reverse a string manually (without using StringBuilder.reverse()).
Q2. Check if a string is a palindrome.
Q3. Find the first non-repeating character.
Q4. Count occurrence of characters using HashMap.
Q5. Check if two strings are anagrams.
Q6. Remove duplicate characters from a string.
Q7. Find the longest substring without repeating characters.
Q8. Find frequency of each word in a sentence.

SECTION 3 – Array & Matrix Problems

Covers loops, data structures, and optimization.

Q1. Find largest and smallest number in an array.
Q2. Find second largest number in an array.
Q3. Reverse an array in place.
Q4. Check if two arrays are equal.
Q5. Move all zeros to end of array.
Q6. Find missing number in a sequence (1…n).
Q7. Find duplicate elements in an array.
Q8. Rotate array by k elements.
Q9. Implement binary search.
Q10. Print spiral order of a matrix.

SECTION 4 – Collections & Map

Every Java interview has a HashMap or List logic question.

Q1. Count frequency of elements using HashMap.
Q2. Sort a HashMap by keys and values.
Q3. Remove duplicates from ArrayList.
Q4. Sort custom objects (like Employee by salary).
Q5. Detect duplicates in a list.
Q6. Implement LRU Cache using LinkedHashMap.
Q7. Iterate and remove elements safely using Iterator.
Q8. Difference between HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.

SECTION 5 – Data Structures & Algorithms

Builds logical problem-solving using Java.

Q1. Implement Stack using array.
Q2. Implement Queue using LinkedList.
Q3. Check balanced parentheses using Stack.
Q4. Reverse a linked list.
Q5. Detect a loop in linked list.
Q6. Find middle element of linked list.
Q7. Perform DFS & BFS on a binary tree.
Q8. Print all leaf nodes of a tree.
Q9. Find height of a binary tree.
Q10. Implement sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion, quicksort).

SECTION 6 – Java 8+ Features

Common for modern interviews (streams, lambdas, optionals).

Q1. Use Stream API to filter even numbers from list.
Q2. Find second highest salary using streams.
Q3. Convert list to map using Collectors.toMap().
Q4. Count words in a list using groupingBy().
Q5. Demonstrate Optional usage to avoid null checks.
Q6. Use flatMap() to flatten nested lists.
Q7. Parallel stream example and its difference from sequential.
Q8. Sort custom objects using Lambda.

SECTION 7 – Multithreading & Concurrency

For 2-year devs, they expect working knowledge.

Q1. Create two threads to print odd and even numbers alternately.
Q2. Implement producer-consumer using wait() and notify().
Q3. Demonstrate synchronization on method and block.
Q4. Use ExecutorService for thread pooling.
Q5. Demonstrate CountDownLatch or CyclicBarrier.
Q6. Show how to make a thread-safe Singleton.
Q7. Create deadlock and solve it.

SECTION 8 – File Handling & Serialization

Common for practical coding rounds.

Q1. Read file line by line and count words.
Q2. Write content to a file.
Q3. Serialize and deserialize a Java object.
Q4. Read large files efficiently using BufferedReader.
Q5. Merge two files into one.

SECTION 9 – JDBC & SQL Integration

Important for full-stack or backend Java roles.

Q1. Connect to MySQL database using JDBC.
Q2. Perform CRUD operations (insert, select, update, delete).
Q3. Use PreparedStatement to avoid SQL injection.
Q4. Handle SQL exceptions gracefully.
Q5. Close all connections using try-with-resources.

SECTION 10 – Real-world Mini Projects

Helps in system design and HR discussion rounds.

Q1. Employee management system (CRUD using OOP).
Q2. ATM simulation.
Q3. Library management system.
Q4. Student grade analyzer using Java 8 streams.
Q5. Basic chat server using sockets.
Q6. Simple Spring Boot REST API (if familiar).

📘 Bonus Topics to Revise:

Java Memory (Stack vs Heap)

Garbage collection

Difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap

Thread safety & immutability

Exception hierarchy

Static vs final vs abstract

It’ll look like a personal Java interview workbook — easy to print and track progress.
